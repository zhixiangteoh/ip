title: Create - Deadline
---

## Function

Creates a Deadline task. Change is written to saved output `duke.txt` file. 

## Description

Creates a Deadline task, marked `[D][笨余`, that is characterized as having both a task description and a date-time
 deadline, marked and appended by the `/by` delimiter. 
 
The `event` command accepts a string of words that is interpreted as the task description, the delimiter `/by
`, followed by a date-time string with the format `yyyy-MM-dd HHmm`.

> Note: If the date-time string entered does not correspond exactly to the `yyyy-MM-dd HHmm` format, the unformatted
> input will be used as the date-time representation for the task. 
 
> If no task description is specified, that is, only the `deadline` command is entered with 0 or more trailing spaces
>, the [`EmptyDescriptionException`](doc11.md) Exception is thrown. 

## Format

```
deadline <task description> /by <date-time>
