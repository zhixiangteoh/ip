## Dependencies

Dude is a lightweight command-line interface (CLI) application that requires only [Java 11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) installed.

> Java 11 and above is highly recommended, although Dude might run on a lower version.

## Installation

Download the latest **Dude** _jar_ release from [here](https://github.com/zhixiangteoh/ip/releases).

## Running the program

Open your command line or terminal and navigate to the folder (e.g., `~/downloads`) where you downloaded the jar file. Then simply run the command `java -jar ip.jar`:
 
```
$ cd ~/downloads
$ ls
ip.jar
$ java -jar ip.jar
```

> Note: Running the above command will create the folder and file `data/duke.txt` in the directory you ran it from.
