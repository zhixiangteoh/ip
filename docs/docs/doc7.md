title: Create - Event

## Function

Creates a Event task. Change is written to saved output `duke.txt` file. 

## Description

Creates an Event task, marked `[E][笨余`, that is characterized as having both a task description and a date-time
 deadline, marked and appended by the `/at` delimiter. 
 
The `event` command accepts a string of words that is interpreted as the task description, the delimiter `/at
`, followed by a date-time string with the format `yyyy-MM-dd HHmm`.

> Note: If the date-time string entered does not correspond exactly to the `yyyy-MM-dd HHmm` format, the unformatted
> input will be used as the date-time representation for the task. 
 
> If no task description is specified, that is, only the `event` command is entered with 0 or more trailing spaces
>, the [`EmptyDescriptionException`](doc11.md) Exception is thrown.

event <task description> /at <date-time>
